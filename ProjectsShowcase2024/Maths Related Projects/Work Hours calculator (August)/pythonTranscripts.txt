Bradford Children’s Services has adopted a Practice Model which is based on: -
A commitment to delivering high quality children’s services that are effective and have a
positive impact on children, young people and families lives in Bradford.
A vision to ensure that children are given the best start in life to be safe, healthy, happy
and resilient.
An aim to consistently deliver services with care and compassion to strengthen families
through a positive working relationship.
A mission to always put children at the heart of all we do.
Our operating Practice Model underpins the ethos of our work with children, young people
and their families and takes into account their experiences. The model utilises the
strengths based approach of Trauma Informed Practice delivered through a Signs of
Safety Approach; both of these approaches allow relationships to flourish.
We are committed to building positive relationships with our children, young people and
families recognising and reinforcing their strengths and their community networks. Our
Practice Model is based on: -
Signs of Safety (SoS): a strengths based, safety orientated approach which focuses on
family strengths to stabilise and strengthen a child’s and families’ situation. It is a way of
working in partnership recognising that families are the experts of their own lives but still
allows for robust assessment of risks, strengths and safety supporting families to identify
their own networks of support.
Relationship Based Practice: the importance of relationships is increasingly recognised
as being central to successful outcomes for our children, young people and their families.
Relationships are the means through which we will work collaboratively with people to
establish a shared understanding of what needs to be done and by whom, in order for any
concerns or problems about a child’s well-being to be resolved.

 Evaluation of AI Search for "How can I add a key agency?"

The AI search performed
 well in retrieving relevant information for the query "How can I add a key agency?".
 

**Strengths:**

* **Accuracy:** The search accurately identified the relevant sections in both the screenshot and the PDF document. 
* **Completeness:** The
 search retrieved all the necessary steps involved in adding a key agency. 
* **Clarity:** The retrieved information is presented in a clear and concise manner. 
*
 **User-friendliness:** The search provides multiple ways to access the information, through both visual and textual formats. 

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Context:** The search results lack context and may not be easily understood by users unfamiliar with the specific
 software or terminology used. 
* **Lack of Explanation:** While the steps are listed, the search results do not provide an explanation for why each step is necessary. 

**Overall:** 

The AI search successfully identified and presented
 the relevant information needed to add a key agency. However, additional improvements could be made to provide more context and explanation for the user. 

**Recommendations:**

* Include a brief introduction to the task of adding a key agency, explaining its purpose and importance within the software. 
* Provide a more detailed explanation for each
 step, explaining its purpose and how it contributes to the overall process. 
* Consider incorporating interactive elements, such as a video tutorial, to further enhance user understanding. 

By addressing these recommendations, the AI search can provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience for users seeking information on how to add a key agency.
