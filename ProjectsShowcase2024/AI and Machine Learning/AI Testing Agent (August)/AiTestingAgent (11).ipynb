            " Alignment with PDF Text: The software accurately captures the functions of most of the buttons described in the PDF text, including the house icon, folder, contract tree, globe, back arrow, magnifying glass, notes, previous page, and next page buttons.\n",
            " Completeness of Major Functions: The analysis covers the functions of all the major buttons on the toolbar, providing users with a clear understanding of their primary functionalities.\n",

This omission could lead to confusion and hinder user experience.\n",

            "Recommendations for Improvement:\n",
            "\n",
            " Expand Functionality Coverage: Enhance the search algorithm to accurately identify and describe the functions of all buttons on the ContrOCC toolbar, leaving no essential information missing.\n",
            " Incorporate Visuals: Supplement the textual descriptions with a visual representation of the toolbar, allowing users to easily locate and identify the buttons they need.\n",
            " Consider Contextual Information: The search results could be further improved by factoring in contextual information from the surrounding text or images within the ContrOCC training guide. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the toolbar functions and their application within specific scenarios.\n",
